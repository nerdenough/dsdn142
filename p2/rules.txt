PImage: Noise clouds generated by me using Gimp
PShape: SVG included in zip, traced from a photo I took.

Rules:
- Black is added to the palette
- White is added to the palette
- Black and white are shuffled so that either the background or one of the text
  elements is black or white
- A random RGB colour is added to the List so that it is always the last colour
  in the list, despite the shuffling previously
- The Vector is always on the opposite side of the canvas to the text elements
- "World" will be coloured, "Hello" will be the opposite BW colour to the bg
- Shading for the Vector will always match the background colour
